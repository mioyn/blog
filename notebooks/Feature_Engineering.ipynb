        "####The Problem Without Scaling:\n",
        "An algorithm that relies on distance metrics (like K-Nearest Neighbors to detect an anomaly) would be completely dominated by the Energy Consumption feature because its values (hundreds) are much larger than the Vibration Level values (single digits) or Temperature values (tens/hundreds). The model would essentially ignore minor, but critical, changes in vibration that signal an impending failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Applying a Scaler (e.g., MinMax Scaler):\n",
        "To ensure all features contribute equally, a MinMaxScaler is applied: Vibration Level is scaled from its range of [0.1, 5.0] to [0, 1].Temperature is scaled from its range of [20, 200] to [0, 1].Energy Consumption is scaled from its range of [10, 500] to [0, 1].\n",
        "#### The Result:\n",
        "The scaled features are all on the same playing field. The machine learning model can now effectively analyze patterns across all three features simultaneously. A sudden spike in vibration, even though its raw value is small, will have an impact comparable to a spike in temperature or energy consumption in the scaled data, leading to faster and more accurate predictions of potential equipment failure.\n"
