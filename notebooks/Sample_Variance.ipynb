        "# Understanding Sample Variance\n",
        "Sample variance is a statistical measure that tells us how spread out the data points are in a sample. It helps quantify the variability of the sample values from the sample mean.\n",

        "\n",
        "For example, if you have test scores from a class and the variance is high, it means students' scores are very spread out; some scored much higher, some much lower. If the variance is low, it means most students performed similarly.\n",
