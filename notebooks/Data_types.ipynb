        "- Cannot be ranked or compared meaningfully.\n",
        "- Used for classification purposes.\n",

        "- Categorical but has a meaningful order or ranking.\n",
        "- Can be ranked, but the difference between categories is not necessarily equal.\n",
        "- Used in surveys, ratings, and classifications.  \n",
