Probability is the measure of how likely an event is to occur. It’s a fundamental concept in mathematics and statistics used to quantify uncertainty.

In simple terms:

A probability of 0 means something is impossible.

A probability of 1 (or 100%) means something is certain to happen.

A probability between 0 and 1 represents the likelihood of an event occurring.

The formula for probability is:

$$
P(E) = \frac{Number-of-favorable-outcomes}{Total-number-of-possible-outcomes}
$$
For example, if you flip a fair coin:

- The probability of getting heads = $\frac{1}{2}$ or 50%.
- The probability of rolling a 6 on a fair six-sided die = $\frac{1}{6} or 16.67%.

### Conditional Probability
Conditional Probability

- The probability of one event occurring given that another event has already happened.
$$
𝑃(𝐴∣𝐵) = \frac{𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵)}{𝑃(𝐵)}
$$

Example: If 40% of students in a school play football and 30% of those also play basketball,
ie, the probability that a student plays basketball given that they play football is 0.3.

$$
P(basketball | footabll) = \frac{P(basketball ∩ football)}{P(football)}
$$
